<p><strong>First, open RStudio.</strong> As their icons can look very similar, be sure you are opening <em>RStudio</em> and not R.</p>
<p>For RStudio to function you must also have R installed on the computer (see the FAQ page for installation instructions). RStudio is an interface (GUI) for easier use of R. You can think of R as being the engine of a vehicle, doing the crucial work, and RStudio as the body of the vehicle (with seats, accessories, etc.) that helps you actually use the engine to move forward! </p>
<p>By default RStudio displays four rectangle panes.</p>

</div>
<p><em>If your RStudio displays only one left pane it is because you have no scripts open yet.</em></p>
<div id="the-r-console-pane" class="section level2">
<h2>The R Console Pane</h2>
<p>The R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R “engine”. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. You can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Stata, the R Console is like the Command Window and also the Results Window.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-source-pane" class="section level2">
<h2>The Source Pane</h2>
<p>This pane, by default in the upper-left, is space to edit and run your scripts, including the RMarkdown outbreak and survey templates. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.</p>
<p>For Stata users, this pane is similar to your Do-file and Data Editor windows.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-environment-pane" class="section level2">
<h2>The Environment Pane</h2>
<p>This pane, by default the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects in the R Environment in the current session. These objects could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined (e.g. a specific epi week for the analysis), or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis (e.g. names of regions). Click on the arrow next to a dataframe name to see its variables.</p>
<p>In Stata, this is most similar to Variables Manager window.</p>
</div>
<div id="plots-packages-and-help-pane" class="section level2">
<h2>Plots, Packages, and Help Pane</h2>
<p>The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).</p>
<p>This pane contains the Stata equivalents of the Plots Manager and Project Manager windows.</p>

<h2>Changing your RStudio settings</h2>
<p>Change RStudio settings and appearance in the Tools drop-down menu, by selecting Global Options</p>
