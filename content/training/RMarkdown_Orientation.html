<h2>What is a script?</h2>
<p>Scripts are files that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Record and organize a sequence of commands in a logical manner</p></li>
<li><p>Facilitate running many commands in rapid succession</p></li>
<li><p>Help to reproduce and share your work with others</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible to enter and run commands directly from the R Console, scripts will be the default way to work.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to save your script as you work!</strong></p>

<h2>What is a RMarkdown?</h2>
<p><strong>The outbreak and survey templates are a type of script called a RMarkdown</strong>.<br />
RMarkdown scripts can contain commands for data cleaning <em>and are themselves the outlines of an automatically-generated document</em> containing text, tables, and plots produced by your code.</p>
<p>You can read more about RMarkdowns here <strong>[need link]</strong></p>

<p><em>In the above RMarkdown template script, the white and gray code chunks produce text and R-generated graphics, respectively, in the Word document output.</em></p>

<div id="code-chunks" class="section level4">
<h4>Code chunks</h4>
<p>While the RMarkdown may at first look like a wall of code, notice how “chunks” of code are differentiated by their background color:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In chunks with WHITE background, code text will appear as text in the document.</strong> These lines can have <em>italics</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, or other formating, and can display parameters derived from your data (such as epi week of outbreak peak, as in the example above).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In chunks with GRAY background, RMarkdown is running R commands.</strong> The commands perform data processing and cleaning steps, or could produce visual outputs in the document.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="commented-code" class="section level4">
<h4>Commented code</h4>
<p>Every script should include helpful text that organizes commands and explains their rationale to collaborators. The <strong># (hash or comment) symbol</strong> ensures that any text <em>after the # and on the same line</em> will not be executed by R as it runs the script. “Commented” text will appear a different color than the code.</p>
<p>In the templates, you will see # serving two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanatory text or section headers.</strong> This commented text can be placed after code, or in the line above.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># An example of commented text  
linelist_raw &lt;- gen_data(&quot;AJS&quot;) # generates a fake dataset for use in this template</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optional commands that can be uncommented as needed.</strong> For example, you can uncomment and run the last command below if your dataset meets the relevant criteria.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># If your linelist is a csv export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data fits the standardised MSF data dictionary for this disease

## Read data ------------------------------------------------------
# CSV file
# linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(&quot;linelist.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Tip: Multiple lines of code can be commented/uncommented by highlighting the lines and pressing the keys Ctrl, Shift, and C at the same time (Ctrl+Shift+C).</p>
