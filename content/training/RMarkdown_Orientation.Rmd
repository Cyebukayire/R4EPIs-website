## What is a script?  
Scripts are files that:  

* Record and organize a sequence of commands in a logical manner  

* Facilitate running many commands in rapid succession  

* Help to reproduce and share your work with others  

While it is possible to enter and run commands directly from the R Console, scripts will be the default way to work.


**Remember to save your script as you work!** 


## What is a RMarkdown Script?

RMarkdown scripts can contain commands such as for data import, cleaning, etc. **and are themselves the outline of an automatically-generated document** containing text, tables, and plots produced by your code.

*In the above RMarkdown template script, the white and gray code chunks produce text and R-generated graphics, respectively, in the Word document output.*  

### Understand a RMarkdown  

#### Code chunks

While the RMarkdown may at first look like a wall of code, notice how "chunks" of code are differentiated by their background color:  

* **In chunks with WHITE background, code text will appear as text in the document.** These lines can have *italics*, **bold**, or other formating, and can display parameters derived from your data (such as epi week of outbreak peak, as in the example above).  

* **In chunks with GRAY background, RMarkdown is running R commands.** The commands perform data processing and cleaning steps, or could produce visual outputs in the document.    

#### Commented code  

Every script should include helpful text that organizes commands and explains their rationale to collaborators. The **# (hash or comment) symbol** ensures that any text *after the # and on the same line* will not be executed by R as it runs the script. Such "commented" text will appear a different color than the code.  

In the templates, you will see **#** serving two purposes:  

* **# Explanatory text or section headers.** This commented text can be placed after code, or in the line above.
```{r eval = FALSE}
# An example of commented text  
linelist_raw <- gen_data("AJS") # generates a fake dataset for use in this template
```
* **# Optional commands that can be uncommented as needed.** For example, you can uncomment and run the last line below if your dataset meets the relevant criteria. 
``` {r eval = FALSE}
# If your linelist is a csv export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data fits the standardised MSF data dictionary for this disease

## Read data ------------------------------------------------------
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")
```

*Tip*: Multiple lines of code can be commented/uncommented by highlighting the lines and pressing the keys Ctrl, Shift, and C at the same time (Ctrl+Shift+C).
