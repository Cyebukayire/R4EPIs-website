<h2>General Syntax</h2>
<p>A few things to remember when writing commands in R, to avoid errors and warnings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always close parentheses</li>
<li>Avoid spaces - in column and object names, etc. Use underscore ( _ ) or periods ( . ) instead</li>
<li>Keep track of and do not forget to separate a function’s arguments with commas</li>
<li>R is case-sensitive, meaning “Variable A” is <em>different</em> from “variable A”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code assists</h3>
<p>Any script (RMarkdown or otherwise) will give clues when you have made a mistake. For example, if you forgot to write a comma where it is needed, or to close a parentheses, RStudio will raise a flag on that line, on the right side of the script, to warn you.</p>

<h2>Errors and Warnings</h2>
<p>When a command is run, the R Console may show you warning or error messages in red text.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>warning</strong> means that R has completed your command, but had to take additional steps or produced unusual output that you should be aware of.</p></li>
<li><p>An <strong>error</strong> means that R was not able to complete your command.</p></li>
</ul>
