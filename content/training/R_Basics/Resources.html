<p><strong>Googling</strong><br />
Typically when you are “stuck”, it is a good strategy to use Google to find notes from other people who have worked through your same problem. If you phrase your search terms carefully, relevant results from Question/Answer sites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">StackExchange</a> will appear and you can often get insights on approach, code examples, and be pointed toward other resources. If you decide to post a question yourself, use these <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example">guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>Resources within RStudio</h2>
<p>Within RStudio you can read the documentation of any package or function that you have installed.</p>
<p>In the <strong>lower-right pane of RStudio</strong> (with tabs: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer), click the <strong>Help tab</strong> and use the search bar to look for names of packages or functions. You can also search Packages and click on the name of a package to see its Help documentation.</p>
<p>For <strong>packages</strong>, the Help page will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A description file<br />
</li>
<li>General description and link to offline Help pages for each function contained within the package</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>functions</strong>, the Help page will contain:</p>
<ul>
