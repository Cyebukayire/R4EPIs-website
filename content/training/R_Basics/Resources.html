<p><strong>Googling</strong><br />
Typically when you are “stuck”, it is a good strategy to use Google to find notes from other people who have worked through your same problem. If you phrase your search terms carefully, relevant results from Question/Answer sites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r">StackExchange</a> will appear and you can often get insights on approach, code examples, and be pointed toward other resources. If you decide to post a question yourself, use these <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example">guidelines</a>.</p>
