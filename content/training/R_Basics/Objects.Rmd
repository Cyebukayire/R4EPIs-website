## Everything is an object  

Everything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are **objects** which are **assigned a name** and **can be referenced** in later commands.  

An object exists when you have assigned it a value (see the assignment section below). When it is assigned a value, the object appears in the Environment (see the upper right pane of RStudio). It can then be operated upon, manipulated, changed, and re-defined.

### Creating objects with the Assignment Operator (`<-`)

**You create objects *by assigning them a value* with the <- operator.** You can think of the assignment operator `<-` as the words "is defined as". Assignment commands generally follow a standard order:  
  
 
**object_name**  <-  **value** (or process/calculation that produce a value)

> **For example:** While using an outbreak template you may want to record the current reporting week for later reference. In this example, the object `reporting_week` is created when it is assigned the character value `"2018-W10"`. `reporting_week` will appear in the R Environment (upper-right pane) and can be referenced in later commands.

> See the commands and their output in the boxes below. Note the [1] in the output is simply indicating that you are viewing the first (and only) item of the output

```{r}
reporting_week <- "2018-W10"   # creates the object reporting_week by assigning a value

reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week
```

{{% notice tip %}}
**IMPORTANT: An object's value can be over-written** at any time by running an assignment command to re-define its value. Thus, the **order of the commands run is very important**.
{{% /notice %}}


```{r}
reporting_week <- "2018-W51"   # assigns a NEW value to the object reporting_week

reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week
```

**Datasets are also assigned names and defined as objects when they are imported.** In the code below:  

1) The object `linelist_raw` is created and assigned the value of an imported CSV file  

2) The object `linelist_cleaned` is created and assigned the value of `linelist_raw`  

3) `linelist_cleaned` is re-defined as itself, but mutated to include a new variable, `obs_days`, representing the number of days between patient admission and exit

```{r eval=FALSE}
# linelist_raw is created and assigned the value of the imported CSV file
linelist_raw <- rio::import(here("linelist.csv"))

# linelist_cleaned is created and assigned the value of linelist_raw
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

# linelist_cleaned is RE-defined as itself, but modified to include a new variable
linelist_cleaned <- mutate(linelist_cleaned, 
                           obs_days = as.numeric(date_of_exit - date_of_admission))


```

You can read more about importing and exporting datasets with the rio package [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/rio/f/vignettes/rio.Rmd)

A quick note on naming of objects:

  * Object names must not contain spaces, but you should use underscore (_) or a period (.) instead of a space.  
  * Object names are case-sensitive (meaning that Dataset_A is different from dataset_A). 
  * Object names must begin with a letter (cannot begin with a number like 1, 2 or 3).  

### Objects can have Structure  

Objects can be a single piece of data (e.g. `my_number <- 24`), or they can consist of structured data. The graphic below, sourced from [this online R tutorial](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html) shows some common data structures and their names. Not included in this image is spatial data, which is discussed in another page.

Using the templates, you will *most commonly* encounter data frames and vectors:  


Common structure | Explanation | Example from templates
------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------  
Vectors | A container for a sequence of singular objects, all of the same class (e.g. numeric, character). | **"Variables" (columns) in data frames are vectors** (e.g. the variable `age_years`).  
Data Frames | Vectors (e.g. columns) that are bound together that all have the same number of rows. | `linelist_raw` and `linelist_cleaned` are both data frames.  

Note that to create a vector that "stands alone", or is not part of a data frame (such as a list of location names), the function `c()` is often used:  
`list_of_names <- c("Ruhengeri", "Gisenyi", "Kigali", "Butare")`  


#### Using `$` to access/call variables  

**Vectors within a data frame (variables in a dataset) can be called or referenced using the $ symbol.** The `$` symbol connects the name of the column to the name of its dataset. The $ symbol must be used, otherwise R will not know where to look for or create the column.  

```{r}
# Retrieve the length of the vector age_years
# (age_years is in the data frame linelist_cleaned)
length(linelist_cleaned$age_years)  
```

By typing the name of the data frame followed by `$` you will also see a list of all variables in the data frame. You can scroll through them using arrow key, select one with your Enter key, and avoid spelling mistakes!

### Objects have Classes  

All the objects stored in R have a *class* which tells R how to handle the object. There are many possible classes, but common ones include:

Class |	Explanation | Examples
------ | ------------------------------------------ |  -----------------------------
Character	| These are text/words/sentences **"within quotation marks"**. Math cannot be done on these objects.	| "Character objects are in quotation marks"  
Numeric	| These are numbers and **can include decimals**. If within quotation marks the will be considered character. | 23.1 or 14  
Integer | Numbers that are **whole only** (no decimals) | -5, 14, or 2000  
Factor | These are vectors that have a **specified order** or hierarchy of values | Variable `msf_involvement` with ordered values N, S, SUB, and U.  
Date | **Once R is told that certain data are Dates**, these data can be manipulated and displayed in special ways. See the page on Dates for more information. | 2018-04-12 or 15/3/1954 or Wed 4 Jan 1980  
Logical | Values must be one of the two special values TRUE or FALSE (note these are **not** "TRUE" and "FALSE" in quotation marks) | TRUE or FALSE  
data.frame | A data frame is how R stores a **typical dataset**. It consists of vectors (columns) of data bound together, that all have the same number of observations (rows). | The example AJS dataset named `linelist_raw` contains 68 variables with 300 observations (rows) each.  

**You can test the class of an object by writing it within the function `class()`**. Note: you can reference a specific column within a dataset using the `$` notation to separate the name of the dataset and the name of the column.

```{r echo=TRUE}
class(linelist_raw$age_years)
class(linelist_raw$patient_origin)
```

The templates sometimes contain code converting objects between classes.

Function | Action  
----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------    
`as.character()` | Converts to character class  
`as.numeric()` | Converts to numeric class  
`as.integer()` | Converts to integer class
`as.Date()` | Converts to Date class - Note: see section on dates for details  
`as.factor()` | Converts to factor - Note: re-defining order of value levels requires extra arguments
