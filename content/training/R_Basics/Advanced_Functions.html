<h2>The Here packge and here() function</h2>
<p>The templates use the <strong>Here package to assist with locating local files</strong>. The Here package and its function here() work well with R projects.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> When the package “Here” is loaded, it automatically considers the top-level folder of your R project as “here” - as a benchmark for all other files in the Project. In your script, if you want to import or reference a file saved in your R project’s folders, you use the function here() to tell R where the file is in relation to “here”.</p>
<p>If you are unsure where “here” is set to, run this command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This command tells you the folder path that &quot;here&quot; is set to 
here()</code></pre>
<p><strong>Below is an example</strong> of importing the file “linelist.xlsx”. The import() function from the rio package does the importing, but <strong>import() needs to be told where to look on your computer</strong> to find the file. Normally, it accepts a filepath in quotes, but it is easy to make mistakes. Instead, <strong>import() is wrapped around the function here()</strong>.</p>
<p>If the file you want is in the folder designated as “here”, all you have to do is provide the name of the file in quotes (with the appropriate ending).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(here(&quot;linelist.xlsx&quot;), which = &quot;Sheet1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: After the closing parenthes of here() the import() function continues. There is a comma and import()’s optional argument <code>which =</code>, specifying which sheet of the Excel file to import.</em></p>
<p><strong>If however, your file is within subfolders of the folder designated as “here”</strong> - let’s say it is in the subfolder “data” and then the sub-subfolder “linelists” - <strong>you write these folder names before the file name, in quotes, and separated by commas</strong>, as below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;linelists&quot;, &quot;linelist.xlsx&quot;), which = &quot;Sheet1&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: by using the Here package and here() function with R projects, it is not necessary to worry about your “working directory”, setwd(), or getwd() commands.</em></p>
