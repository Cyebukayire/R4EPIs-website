<div id="importing-data-and-the-here-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Importing data and the here() function</h2>
<p><strong>The templates use the function here() in conjunction with import() to locate and import local files.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The function import() from the package “rio” makes it easy to import many types of files.</strong> It uses the file’s extension (e.g. .xlsx, .csv, .dta, etc.) to appropriately read the file. You can read more about import() <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html">on this page</a>. If importing an Excel file, the templates use import()’s argument <code>which=</code> to specify the sheet to import.</p>
<p>However, <strong>import() needs to be told where to look on your computer</strong> to find the file. For this, <strong>we have wrapped import() around the function here()</strong>. Normally, import() accepts a filepath in quotes, but it is easy to make mistakes that way.</p>
<p><strong>The function here() from the package “Here” makes it easy to locate local files.</strong> here() works well within R projects. When the package is first loaded, it automatically considers the top-level folder of your R project as “here” - as a benchmark for all other files in the Project. In your script, if you want to import or reference a file saved in your R project’s folders, you use the function here() to tell R where the file is in relation to that benchmark.</p>
<p>If you are unsure where “here” is set to, run this command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This command tells you the folder path that &quot;here&quot; is set to 
here()</code></pre>
<p><strong>Below is an example</strong> of importing the file “linelist.xlsx”. If the file you want is in the folder designated as “here”, all you have to do is provide the name of the file in quotes (with the appropriate ending).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(here(&quot;linelist.xlsx&quot;), which = &quot;Sheet1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: After the closing parenthes of here() the import() function continues. There is a comma and import()’s optional argument <code>which =</code>, specifying which sheet of the Excel file to import.</em></p>
<p><strong>If however, your file is within subfolders of the folder designated as “here”</strong> - let’s say it is in the subfolder “data” and then the sub-subfolder “linelists” - <strong>you write these folder names before the file name, in quotes, and separated by commas</strong>, as below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;linelists&quot;, &quot;linelist.xlsx&quot;), which = &quot;Sheet1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You can read more about Here and here() at <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/here_here">this site</a> and <a href="https://here.r-lib.org/">this one</a></p>
<p><em>Note: by using the Here package and here() function with R projects, it is not necessary to worry about your “working directory”, setwd(), or getwd() commands.</em></p>

<div id="joins" class="section level2">
<h2>Joins</h2>
<p>The package dplyr contains functions that are used in the templates for joining (“merging”) data frames. There are many options for joins, and it is important that you use the correct one - otherwise you risk losing data unexpectedly.</p>
<p>It is wise to verify any join by inspecting the joined data frames and the resulting data frame.</p>
<p>There are more reference materials on dyplr join functions <a href="https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html">here</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/williamsurles/293454">here</a>, and the animations below can be acccessed <a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain">here</a>.</p>

<div id="the-in-operator" class="section level3">
<h3>The %in% operator</h3>
<p>The operator %in% looks to see if a value is present within a vector. A vector can be created with the function c(), and a variable in a data frame is also a vector.</p>
<p>In the simple example below, R is asked if the number 4 is present in the vector “numbers”:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Vector is defined
numbers &lt;- c(4, 10, 5, 365, 12, 0.5, 9)

# Test if 5 is in the vector
5 %in% numbers</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>In the templates, %in% can be used when creating the valued “DIED” (when a patient died). The variable DIED is logical (either TRUE or FALSE). It will be TRUE if the value in exit_status is either “DD” or “DOA” - those are the two character values present in the vector. You can add to or change the terms listed in the vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#DIED == TRUE if value in exit_status is &quot;DD&quot; or &quot;DOA&quot;
linelist_cleaned$DIED &lt;- linelist_cleaned$exit_status %in% c(&quot;DD&quot;, &quot;DOA&quot;))</code></pre>

<h3>Factors and the forcats() package</h3>
<div id="factors" class="section level4">
<h4>Factors</h4>
<p>Factors are a special variable class in which data are stored as integers, but each integer <em>level</em> has a corresponding character value that is used when the data are displayed. TODO: Factors are similar to XXXX in Stata.</p>
<p>TODO EXAMPLE</p>
<p>You can read more about factors <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html">here</a>.</p>

<div id="forcats-and-dropping-factor-levels" class="section level4">
<h4>forcats and dropping factor levels</h4>
<p>If a variable is already a factor, it can be difficult to remove value levels without any observations. These levels will continue to appear in graphs, tables, etc. For example,</p>
<p>TODO Example</p>
<p>The package forcats and its function fct_drop() will drop “unusued” levels of a factor, in effect cleaning it of unused levels. See this example:</p>
<p>TODO follow-up example.</p>
