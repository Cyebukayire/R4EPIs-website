## General Syntax  

A few things to remember when writing commands in R, to avoid errors and warnings:  

* Always close parentheses - tip: count the number of opening "(" and closing parentheses ")" for each code chunk
* Avoid spaces in column and object names. Use underscore ( _ ) or periods ( . ) instead
* Keep track of and remember to separate a function's arguments with commas
* R is case-sensitive, meaning `Variable_A` is *different* from `variable_A`


### Code assists  

Any script (RMarkdown or otherwise) will give clues when you have made a mistake. For example, if you forgot to write a comma where it is needed, or to close a parentheses, RStudio will raise a flag on that line, on the right side of the script, to warn you.

## Errors and Warnings  

When a command is run, the R Console may show you warning or error messages in red text.  

* A **warning** means that R has completed your command, but had to take additional steps or produced unusual output that you should be aware of.  

* An **error** means that R was not able to complete your command.  

Look for clues: 

* The error/warning message will often include a line number for the problem.  

* If an object "is unknown" or "not found", perhaps you spelled it incorrectly, forgot to call a package with library(), or forgot to re-run your script after making changes.  

If all else fails, copy the error message into Google along with some key terms - chances are that someone else has worked through this already!
