## General Syntax  

A few things to remember when writing commands in R, to avoid errors and warnings:  

* Always close parentheses
* Avoid spaces - in column and object names, etc. Use underscore ( _ ) or periods ( . ) instead
* Keep track of and do not forget to separate a function's arguments with commas
* R is case-sensitive, meaning "Variable A" is *different* from "variable A"


### Code assists  
Any script (RMarkdown or otherwise) will give clues when you have made a mistake. For example, if you forgot to write a comma where it is needed, or to close a parentheses, RStudio will raise a flag on that line, on the right side of the script, to warn you.

## Errors and Warnings  

When a command is run, the R Console may show you warning or error messages in red text.  

* A **warning** means that R has completed your command, but had to take additional steps or produced unusual output that you should be aware of.  

* An **error** means that R was not able to complete your command.
