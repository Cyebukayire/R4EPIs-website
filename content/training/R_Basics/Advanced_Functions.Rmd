### Factors and the **forcats** package  

#### Factors

Factors are a special variable class in which data are stored internally as integers, but each integer *level* has a corresponding character value *label* that is used when the data are displayed. This can be partularly helpful when running statistical models which expect numeric (e.g. 0/1) inputs.  

{{% notice tip %}}
Factors are similar to labeled values of categorical variables in Stata.

You can [read more about factors here](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html).  

The package **forcats** provides useful tools for working with factor variables. You can [read more about **forcats** here](https://forcats.tidyverse.org).  

> For example, in the automatically generated AJS dataset, the variable `sex` is a factor. In the underlying dataset the levels are F, M, and U, but we can attach longer character labels that are displayed.  

```{r}
# Use auto-generated dataset for this example
linelist_cleaned <- gen_data("AJS")

# the variable is a factor. 
class(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

{{% notice tip %}}
To convert use `as.factor()` `linelist_cleaned$sex <- as.factor(linelist_cleaned$sex)` 
{{% /notice %}}

**To change the labels for a variable, use the function `fct_recode()` from the package forcats.**  

After providing the name of the factor give the conversion statements, separated by commas, in the format **NEW = "OLD"**. Note that everything on the right-hand side (RHS) must be a character. So, if you want to give a new label to missing values, use the special term `NA_character_`.  

First we use `fct_count()` from the package **forcats** to see the values in the factor:

```{r}
# View the levels present in the variable
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

Now we re-label the values using `fct_recode()`, also from the package **forcats**.  

```{r}
# Re-define the labels for the factor variable (pay attention to spelling!)
linelist_cleaned$sex <- fct_recode(linelist_cleaned$sex, 
                                   Male = "M",
                                   Female = "F",
                                   Unknown = "U")

# View the levels present in the variable
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

**To change the *arrangement* of the levels, use `fct_relevel()`**.  

This will impact the *arrangement* of the levels as displayed in graphs and tables. Give the name of the factor followed by the new arrangement (pay attention to spelling!).  


```{r}
# Provide new arrangement of levels
linelist_cleaned$sex <- fct_relevel(linelist_cleaned$sex, "Female", "Male", "Unknown")

# Check arrangement of levels
levels(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```


#### Dropping factor levels  

If a variable is already a factor, it can be difficult to remove levels that do not have any observations. These levels will continue to appear in graphs, tables, etc.  

> **For example:** here we look at the values present in the variable sex. We want to convert those that are "Unknown" to proper R missing values (`NA`).

```{r}
# Convert "Unknown" values to missing
linelist_cleaned$sex[linelist_cleaned$sex == "Unknown"] <- NA

# see the values and counts in the factor variable sex
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

> We can see that the value "Unknown" now has a count of zero, but it is still present as a level of the factor variable and will appear in tables and graphs. To remove this level entirely we use `fct_drop()`, which drops unused levels from a factor.

```{r}
# Drop unused levels
linelist_cleaned$sex <- fct_drop(linelist_cleaned$sex)

# see the values and counts in the factor variable sex
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
``` 


{{% notice tip %}}
Use the argument `only = ` to drop specific levels: `fct_drop(linelist_cleaned$sex, only = "Unknown")`
{{% /notice %}}


### The `%in%` operator  

The `%in%` operator looks to see if any elements of a vector are within another vector. **You can use this to filter your data to a specific set of values.** It's like a parallel version of `==`. A vector can be created with the function `c()`, and a variable in a data frame is also a vector. 

Here, we show how `%in%` can be used to find which letters in the word "epidemiology" are vowels:

```{r}
epi <- c("e", "p", "i", "d", "e", "m", "i", "o", "l", "o", "g", "y")
epi

# use %in% to ask "for each letter in epi, is it in the list of vowels (a, e, i, o, u)?"
are_vowels <- epi %in% c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")

# the result is a logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector
are_vowels

# this new vector can be used to subset our original vector
# the following returns only the letters in epi that evaluated to TRUE in epi_vowels
epi[are_vowels]
```

In the templates, `%in%` can be used when creating the variable `DIED` (when a patient died). The variable `DIED` is logical (either `TRUE` or `FALSE`). It will be `TRUE` if the value in `exit_status` is either "DD" or "DOA" - those are the two character values present in the vector. You can add to or change the terms listed in the vector.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# DIED is set to TRUE if value in exit_status is "DD" or "DOA"
linelist_cleaned$DIED <- linelist_cleaned$exit_status %in% c("DD", "DOA")
```

## Joins  

The package **dplyr** contains functions that are used in the templates for joining ("merging") data frames. 
There are many ways to conduct a join, and it is important that you use the correct option - otherwise you risk unexpectedly losing data!

It is wise to verify any join by inspecting the joined data frames and the resulting data frame. 

There are more reference materials on dplyr join functions [in the cheat sheet from UBC's STAT545 course (by Jenny Bryan)](https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html) and [course notes from William Srules](https://rpubs.com/williamsurles/293454).

### Inner join  

An inner join of data frames x and y (`inner_join(x, y)`) returns **only** the rows from x which have matching values in y, and includes all the columns from both x and y.  

The argument `by = ` specifies the column name in both data frames to compare for the join (it must be spelled the same in both data frames).

### Left join  

A left join of data frames x and y (`left_join(x, y)`) prioritizes only the "left" data frame (x), thus returning all rows from x with all columns from x and y. If a row in x has multiple matches in y, all combinations are returned as separate rows.  

The argument `by = ` specifies the column name in both data frames to compare for the join (it must be spelled the same in both data frames).   

For example, a left join occurs in the AJS template when calculating attack rate by region, where `cases` and `population_data` are joined by their variable `patient_origin`. 

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, patient_origin) %>%   # cases for each region
  left_join(population_data, by = "patient_origin")    # merge population data 
```

### Full join  

A full join of data frames x and y (`full_join(x, y)`) returns all rows from x and y. If there are any rows in x not in y (or visa-versa), the missing values are `NA`.

### Anti join  

This is often used to inspect which rows are unique to a data frame. An anti join of data frames x and y (`anti_join(x, y)`) returns the rows from data frame x that *do not* have matching values in data frame y. Only columns from x are returned.
