### Factors and the **forcats** package  

#### Factors

Factors are a special variable class in which data are stored internally as integers, but each integer *level* has a corresponding character value *label* that is used when the data are displayed. This can be partularly helpful when running statistical models which expect numeric (e.g. 0/1) inputs.  

{{% notice tip %}}
Factors are similar to labeled values of categorical variables in Stata.  
{{% /notice %}}

You can [read more about factors here](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html).  

The package **forcats** provides useful tools for working with factor variables. You can [read more about **forcats** here](https://forcats.tidyverse.org).  

> For example, in the automatically generated AJS dataset, the variable `sex` is a factor. In the underlying dataset the levels are F, M, and U, but we can attach longer character labels that are displayed.  

```{r}
# Use auto-generated dataset for this example
linelist_cleaned <- gen_data("AJS")

# the variable is a factor. 
class(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

{{% notice tip %}}
To convert use `as.factor()` `linelist_cleaned$sex <- as.factor(linelist_cleaned$sex)` 
{{% /notice %}}

**To change the labels for a variable, use the function `fct_recode()` from the package forcats.**  

After providing the name of the factor give the conversion statements, separated by commas, in the format **NEW = "OLD"**. Note that everything on the right-hand side (RHS) must be a character. So, if you want to give a new label to missing values, use the special term `NA_character_`.  

First we use `fct_count()` from the package **forcats** to see the values in the factor:

```{r}
# View the levels present in the variable
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

Now we re-label the values using `fct_recode()`, also from the package **forcats**.  

```{r}
# Re-define the labels for the factor variable (pay attention to spelling!)
linelist_cleaned$sex <- fct_recode(linelist_cleaned$sex, 
                                   Male = "M",
                                   Female = "F",
                                   Unknown = "U")

# View the levels present in the variable
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

**To change the *arrangement* of the levels, use `fct_relevel()`**.  

This will impact the *arrangement* of the levels as displayed in graphs and tables. Give the name of the factor followed by the new arrangement (pay attention to spelling!).  


```{r}
# Provide new arrangement of levels
linelist_cleaned$sex <- fct_relevel(linelist_cleaned$sex, "Female", "Male", "Unknown")

# Check arrangement of levels
levels(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```


#### Dropping factor levels  

If a variable is already a factor, it can be difficult to remove levels that do not have any observations. These levels will continue to appear in graphs, tables, etc.  

> **For example:** here we look at the values present in the variable sex. We want to convert those that are "Unknown" to proper R missing values (`NA`).

```{r}
# Convert "Unknown" values to missing
linelist_cleaned$sex[linelist_cleaned$sex == "Unknown"] <- NA

# see the values and counts in the factor variable sex
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
```

> We can see that the value "Unknown" now has a count of zero, but it is still present as a level of the factor variable and will appear in tables and graphs. To remove this level entirely we use `fct_drop()`, which drops unused levels from a factor.

```{r}
# Drop unused levels
linelist_cleaned$sex <- fct_drop(linelist_cleaned$sex)

# see the values and counts in the factor variable sex
fct_count(linelist_cleaned$sex)
``` 


{{% notice tip %}}
Use the argument `only = ` to drop specific levels: `fct_drop(linelist_cleaned$sex, only = "Unknown")`
{{% /notice %}}


### The `%in%` operator  

The `%in%` operator looks to see if any elements of a vector are within another vector. **You can use this to filter your data to a specific set of values.** It's like a parallel version of `==`. A vector can be created with the function `c()`, and a variable in a data frame is also a vector. 

Here, we show how `%in%` can be used to find which letters in the word "epidemiology" are vowels:

```{r}
epi <- c("e", "p", "i", "d", "e", "m", "i", "o", "l", "o", "g", "y")
epi

# use %in% to ask "for each letter in epi, is it in the list of vowels (a, e, i, o, u)?"
are_vowels <- epi %in% c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")

# the result is a logical (TRUE/FALSE) vector
are_vowels

# this new vector can be used to subset our original vector
# the following returns only the letters in epi that evaluated to TRUE in epi_vowels
epi[are_vowels]
```

In the templates, `%in%` can be used when creating the variable `DIED` (when a patient died). The variable `DIED` is logical (either `TRUE` or `FALSE`). It will be `TRUE` if the value in `exit_status` is either "DD" or "DOA" - those are the two character values present in the vector. You can add to or change the terms listed in the vector.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# DIED is set to TRUE if value in exit_status is "DD" or "DOA"
linelist_cleaned$DIED <- linelist_cleaned$exit_status %in% c("DD", "DOA")
```

You can [read more about the `%in%` here](http://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/in-operator-in-r/)


## Joins  

The package **dplyr** contains functions that are used in the templates for joining ("merging") data frames. 
There are many ways to conduct a join, and it is important that you use the correct option - otherwise you risk unexpectedly losing data!

It is wise to verify any join by inspecting the joined data frames and the resulting data frame. 

There are more reference materials on dplyr join functions [in the cheat sheet from UBC's STAT545 course (by Jenny Bryan)](https://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html) and [course notes from William Srules](https://rpubs.com/williamsurles/293454). 
The animations below were originally from https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain.

### Inner join  

An inner join of data frames x and y (`inner_join(x, y)`) returns **only** the rows from x which have matching values in y, and includes all the columns from both x and y.  

The argument `by = ` specifies the column name in both data frames to compare for the join (it must be spelled the same in both data frames). 


![](/images/inner-join.gif)

### Left join  

A left join of data frames x and y (`left_join(x, y)`) prioritizes only the "left" data frame (x), thus returning all rows from x with all columns from x and y. If a row in x has multiple matches in y, all combinations are returned as separate rows.  

The argument `by = ` specifies the column name in both data frames to compare for the join (it must be spelled the same in both data frames).   

For example, a left join occurs in the AJS template when calculating attack rate by region, where `cases` and `population_data` are joined by their variable `patient_origin`. 

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, patient_origin) %>%   # cases for each region
  left_join(population_data, by = "patient_origin")    # merge population data 
```

### Full join  

A full join of data frames x and y (`full_join(x, y)`) returns all rows from x and y. If there are any rows in x not in y (or visa-versa), the missing values are `NA`.  
   

![](/images/full-join.gif)  

### Anti join  

This is often used to inspect which rows are unique to a data frame. An anti join of data frames x and y (`anti_join(x, y)`) returns the rows from data frame x that *do not* have matching values in data frame y. Only columns from x are returned.

## Graphics with the **ggplot2** package  


R has the capability to make beautiful and versatile graphics using the package **ggplot2** and its function `ggplot()`. Below is a brief overview of the use of `ggplot()`. **There are too many aspects of `ggplot()` to cover here, so it is highly encouraged that you download and review [this ggplot cheatsheet](/public_data/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf). **  

For further reading, see [this data visualization tutorial](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [this gallery of visualizations and extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) for inspiration.  

### Core components  

A `ggplot()` command is typically built using sub-commands linked by `+` symbols. The sub-commands are executed one-after-another to build the final plot. The core components to provide are:  

* **a data set** - can be a standard data frame, or a spatial shapefile  
* **coordinate system** - the x and y axes reflect the range of values within specified variables
* **geom** - the geometric marks to visualize the data (e.g. points, lines, polygons, etc)  
* **aesthetics** - linking attributes such as color and size of geoms to variables in the data set  

The first command `ggplot()` creates an empty coordinate system to which layers of visualization and nuance are added.  
* Its first argument specifies the data set to use.  
* Its `aes()` argument establishes the variables to be mapped to the x and y axes.  

Secondly, the geom is specified, indicating whether the data should be displayed as points, lines, bars, a map, etc. Without a geom, the data will not be visualized and the coordinate plane will be empty.  

Other optional sub-commands can address the scale, labels, aesthetic themes and colors, etc. Note there are other ways to structure a ggplot() command, but the way described above is used in the template. When making a graphic, it often helps to look at examples online and mimic the code that produced them.  

![](/images/ggplot.png)
{{% notice tip %}}
A command beginning with `ggplot()` will print the visualization but not save it. Using the assignment operator `<-` in the first line will assign the visualization to an R object and save it for later use. Print it by running a command of just the object name.
{{% /notice %}}  

### Geospatial mapping  

In the Place section of the template, `ggplot()` is used to create geospatial maps of attack rates and other indicators. In these cases, the coordinate system reflects latitude/longitude, and `ggplot()` uses `geom_sf()` to accept and display points, polygons, or lines shapefiles (geom_sf is shorthand for "spatial file").


### Aesthetic themes and labels  

In the outbreak templates, detailed aesthetics parameters are managed by creating "theme" objects that can be referenced multiple in multiple `ggplot()` commands.  

Below, the object `epicurve_theme` is assigned certain `ggplot()` aesthetic parameters such as x-axis text angle, absence of legend title, and grid-line color. This object is then referenced in `ggplot()` commands throughout the template.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# this sets the theme in ggplot for epicurves
epicurve_theme <- theme(
  axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
  legend.title = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey60", linetype = 3),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey60", linetype = 3)
)
```

Likewise, this chunk establishes the settings for the labels in epidemic curve graphics. The settings for x-axis and y-axis labels, title, and subtitle are stored in the `epicurve_labels` object, which is referenced in several epidemic curve `ggplot()` commands.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This sets the labels in ggplot for the epicurves
epicurve_labels <- labs(x = "Calendar week", 
                        y = "Cases (n)", 
                        title = "Cases by week of onset",
                        subtitle = sprintf("Source: MSF data from %s", reporting_week)
                       ) 
```

 


## For loop  

A **for loop** is used to repeat or iterate code, making repetitive tasks more efficient. The "loop" repeats a series of commands, altering them slightly to account for different input values that are stored in a vector. This vector, or sequence of values, can be the values within a data frame variable. 

In the outbreak templates, a **for loop** is used at the end of the **Place** analyses to create bar graphs and maps of regional attack rates *for each epidemiological week*.  

The basic structure of a **for loop** is as follows:  

* **Setup**, including :  
     * The keyword `for` (note the lowercase)  
     * Parentheses containing:  
          * A placeholder term (e.g. "i", "value", or another relevant short word)  
          * The keyword `in`  
          * The name of the vector to loop through  
     * Opening bracket `{`  

* **Actions** and commands to be performed for each item in the vector  
     * If the item is referenced in any command, use the placeholder term instead.  
     
* **Closing** - A closing bracket `}`
      

A basic example **for loop** is below. `number_list` is defined as a vector of four numbers. The **for loop** is set-up to examine each item ("i") in `number_list`. The only command in the **for loop** is to print the value of "i" plus 2. Finally, the brackets are closed. As the loop executes, it produces one output for each item in `number_list`.

```{r}
number_list <- c(102, 53, 14, 88)

for (i in number_list) {
     print(i + 2)
}
```

In the outbreak templates, the **for loop** is more complex than the simple example above, but follows the same basic structure.  

The loop is set-up for each item "i" of all the unique values in the variable `epiweek` within the data frame `cases`. This vector is a list of the epidemiological weeks with no repeated values. If you want to see this vector of epidemiological weeks, highlight and run just `unique(cases$epiweek)`.  

Numerous commands are located within the loop's brackets `{ }`, but the most important is the first: `this_ar <- filter(ar, epiweek == i)`. This command restricts the large data frame `ar` to only the epiweek currently under consideration by the **for loop**. *Thus, the data frame `this_ar` will be different for each iteration of the **for loop** *. All the subsequent steps (producing a map and a barplot) are performed on this filtered dataset.  

The final step produces a `cowplot()` visualization that includes the map and the barplot for the current epiweek "i". After producing the cowplot, the loop advances "i" to the next epiweek item in the vector, repeats all the commands in the brackets `{ }`, and produces a new cowplot.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# go through each epiweek, fiter and plot the data
for (i in unique(cases$epiweek)) {
  this_ar <- filter(ar, epiweek == i)
  
  # map 
  mapsub <- left_join(map, this_ar, by = c("name" = "Region"))
  
  # choropleth 
  map_plot <- ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = mapsub, aes(fill = categories), col = "grey50") + # shapefile as polygon
    coord_sf(datum = NA) + # needed to avoid gridlines being drawn
    annotation_scale() + # add a scalebar
  scale_fill_brewer(drop = FALSE, 
                    palette = "OrRd", 
                    name = "AR (per 10,000)") +  # color the scale to be perceptually uniform (keep levels)
    theme_void() # remove coordinates and axes
  
  # plot with the region on the x axis sorted by increasing ar
  # ar value on the y axis 
  barplot <- ggplot(this_ar, aes(x = reorder(Region, `AR (per 10,000)`),
                                 y = `AR (per 10,000)`)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", fill = "red") + # plot as bars (identity = as is)
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = `Lower 95%CI`, ymax = `Upper 95%CI`), width = 0.2) + # add CIs
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max_ar)) +  # set origin for axes
    # add labels to axes and below chart
    labs(x = "Region", y = "AR (per 10,000)", 
         captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week)) + 
    epicurve_theme
  # combine the barplot and map plot into one
  print(
    cowplot::plot_grid(
      barplot + labs(title = paste0("Epiweek: ", i)),
      map_plot,
      nrow = 1,
      align = "h",
      axis = "tb"
    )
  )
}
```
