## The Here packge and here() function  

The templates use the **Here package to assist with locating local files**. The Here package and its function here() work well with R projects.  

**How it works:** When the package "Here" is loaded, it automatically considers the top-level folder of your R project as "here" - as a benchmark for all other files in the Project. In your script, if you want to import or reference a file saved in your R project's folders, you use the function here() to tell R where the file is in relation to "here".  

If you are unsure where "here" is set to, run this command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This command tells you the folder path that "here" is set to 
here()
```


**Below is an example** of importing the file "linelist.xlsx". The import() function from the rio package does the importing, but **import() needs to be told where to look on your computer** to find the file. Normally, it accepts a filepath in quotes, but it is easy to make mistakes. Instead, **import() is wrapped around the function here()**. 

If the file you want is in the folder designated as "here", all you have to do is provide the name of the file in quotes (with the appropriate ending). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
linelist_raw <- rio::import(here("linelist.xlsx"), which = "Sheet1")
```

*Note: After the closing parenthes of here() the import() function continues. There is a comma and import()'s optional argument `which = `, specifying which sheet of the Excel file to import.*  

**If however, your file is within subfolders of the folder designated as "here"** - let's say it is in the subfolder "data" and then the sub-subfolder "linelists" - **you write these folder names before the file name, in quotes, and separated by commas**, as below:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
linelist_raw <- rio::import(here("data", "linelists", "linelist.xlsx"), which = "Sheet1")
```

*Note: by using the Here package and here() function with R projects, it is not necessary to worry about your "working directory", setwd(), or getwd() commands.*

## Joins  

The animations below can be acccessed [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain).

### Left join  

An example of a left join from the AJS outbreak template occurs in the TODO

### The %in% operator  

The operator %in% looks to see if a value is present within a vector. A vector can be created with the function c(), and a variable in a data frame is also a vector. 

In the simple example below, R is asked if the number 4 is present in the vector "numbers":

```{r}
# Vector is defined
numbers <- c(4, 10, 5, 365, 12, 0.5, 9)

# Test if 5 is in the vector
5 %in% numbers
```

In the templates, %in% can be used when creating the valued "DIED" (when a patient died). The variable DIED is logical (either TRUE or FALSE). It will be TRUE if the value in exit_status is either "DD" or "DOA" - those are the two character values present in the vector. You can add to or change the terms listed in the vector.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#DIED == TRUE if value in exit_status is "DD" or "DOA"
linelist_cleaned$DIED <- linelist_cleaned$exit_status %in% c("DD", "DOA"))
```
