<p><strong>It is strongly encouraged to organize your work within a self-contained R project</strong>. An <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects">R project</a> is a way to store all files related to one project in one place (R scripts, source files, location of the R working directory, RStudio workspace).</p>

<h2>Opening a new R project</h2>
<p>Select <em>File -&gt; New Project</em> from the top RStudio menu.</p>
<p>Creating a new R project will create:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new project directory (folder)<br />
</li>
<li>A R project file (.Rproj) in the project folder that serves as a shortcut to open the project via RStudio</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can make sub-folders for data, scripts, etc.<br />
</li>
<li>All files produced by R scripts saved to the project will also save into the project folder</li>
</ul>
<p>Navigate and open project files, such as scripts, using the Files tab of the lower-right RStudio pane.</p>

<h2>Sending an R project</h2>
<p>One significant benefit of working within an R project is that all associated files (datasets, etc.) are located within the same folder. Thus, to send the project to someone else, <strong>simply zip the folder and send</strong>. All files referenced in the scripts are included and no file pathways in the script are unique to your computer.</p>
