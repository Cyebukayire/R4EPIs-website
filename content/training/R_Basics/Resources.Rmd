## Online resources  

Below are links to some of the many online tutorials for learning R.

[Fundamentals of R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)  

[R for Novices (written for journalists)](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/introduction/)  

[Clinical Epidemiology in R, from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](http://rpubs.com/michaelmarks/R-Clin-Epi)  

[Resources page of R for Epidemics Consortium (RECON) website](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/resources/)  

[Tutorial for learning ggplot (the most common R package for visualizations, graphs, and maps)](http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html)  

**Googling**  
Typically when you are "stuck", it is a good strategy to use Google to find notes from other people who have worked through your same problem. If you phrase your search terms carefully, relevant results from Question/Answer sites such as [StackExchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) will appear and you can often get insights on approach, code examples, and be pointed toward other resources. If you decide to post a question yourself, use these [guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).
