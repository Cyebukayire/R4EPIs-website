## Online resources  

Below are links to some of the many online tutorials for learning R.

[Fundamentals of R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)  

[Introduction to R, greater focus on base R](https://intro2r.com)

[R for Novices (written for journalists)](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/introduction/)  

[Data Science: R Basics, Harvard University EDX course](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics)

**Googling**  
Typically when you are "stuck", it is a good strategy to use Google to find notes from other people who have worked through your same problem. If you phrase your search terms carefully, relevant results from Question/Answer sites such as [StackExchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) will appear and you can often get insights on approach, code examples, and be pointed toward other resources. If you decide to post a question yourself, use these [guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).  


## Resources within RStudio  

Within RStudio you can read the documentation of any package or function that you have installed.  

In the **lower-right pane of RStudio** (with tabs: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer), click the **Help tab** and use the search bar to look for names of packages or functions. You can also search Packages and click on the name of a package to see its Help documentation.  

For **packages**, the Help page will contain:  

* A description file  
* General description and link to offline Help pages for each function contained within the package 

For **functions**, the Help page will contain:  

* A general description  
* Usage, showing the required and optional arguments and their expected order within the function.  
* Detailed requirements of each argument  
* Examples of use
