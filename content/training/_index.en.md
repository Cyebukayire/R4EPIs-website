## The case study walk-through

These pages demonstrate application of the Acute Jaundice Syndrome (AJS) outbreak template to
produce an epidemiological situation report for an outbreak that occurred in Am Timan, Chad. 

The un-standardised nature of this dataset allows demonstration of many techniques to modify the template.
