title: Training Materials

Welcome to the training homepage of the R4EPIs project. The purpose of these pages are to assist you in the use
and modification of the outbreak and survey templates. 

## R basics

These pages provide an introduction to RStudio and R, with a focus on the functions and structures found in the templates.


## Case study walk-through

These pages demonstrate application of the Acute Jaundice Syndrome (AJS) outbreak template to
produce an epidemiological situation report for an outbreak that occurred in Am Timan, Chad. 

The dataset used is not standardised to DHIS or any data dictionary, and therefore allows demonstration of many techniques
to modify the template. Read more about the case study walk-through in its introduction page.
