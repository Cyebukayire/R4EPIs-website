Welcome to the training homepage of the R4EPIs project. The purpose of these pages are to assist you in the use
and modification of the outbreak and survey templates. 

## [R basics](https://r4epis.netlify.com/training/r_basics/)

These pages provide an introduction to R and RStudio, with a focus on the functions and code structures found in the templates.


## [Case study walk-through](https://r4epis.netlify.com/training/walk-through/case_study_overview/)

These pages demonstrate use of the Acute Jaundice Syndrome (AJS) outbreak template to
produce an epidemiological situation report for an outbreak that occurred in Am Timan, Chad.

The datasets used and the final template script can be downloaded from the [Case Study Overview](https://r4epis.netlify.com/training/walk-through/case_study_overview/) page. 

The datasets used are *not* standardised to DHIS or any data dictionary. This allows demonstration of many techniques
to modify the template.
