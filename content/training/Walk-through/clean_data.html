<div id="standardize-and-clean-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Standardize and clean data</h2>
<p>Becuase the Am Timan dataset is not yet aligned with the MSF data dictionary and what the template expects, there are several data cleaning steps we must complete.</p>
<div id="re-code-missing-values-from-periods-.-to-na-at-import" class="section level3">
<h3>Re-code missing values from periods (.) to <code>NA</code> at import</h3>
<p>Currently, missing values in the dataset are represented by a period (.). This causes problems because R expects missing values to be coded as <code>NA</code>. For example, if we attempt to set the variable date_of_onset to class Date, R gives an error because the periods are considered character values that do not fit the expected YYYY-MM-DD date format.</p>
<p>To fix this problem we <strong>scroll up to the read_nonDHIS_data chunk of the template and insert an additional argument in the rio::import command</strong>. The argument <code>na = &quot;.&quot;</code> specifies a period as the value in the Excel sheet that R will consider to be “missing”. As the data are re-imported, all cells with that value are now changed to <code>NA</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Remember that after making this change to the import command you must re-run the entire script. This way, the dataset is correctly imported AND the later cleaning steps, changes to variable names, etc. are also performed on this newly-imported dataset</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code># The old import command
linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(&quot;AJS_AmTiman.xlsx&quot;, which = &quot;linelist&quot;)

# The revised import command (don&#39;t forget the comma between arguments!)
linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(&quot;AJS_AmTiman.xlsx&quot;, which = &quot;linelist&quot;, na = &quot;.&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="drop-ineligible-observations" class="section level3">
<h3>Drop ineligible observations</h3>
<p>The next code item in the script drops observations with missing case_number or date_of_consultation_admission. Because the Am Timan dataset contains observations for patients seen in the community and at the hospital, these criteria may not be relevant. We can check and see that of the 1447 observations, there are 0 missing case_number or dateentry, but 616 observations missing date_of_admission. These 616 community-identified cases are still of interest for our report, so we will not drop them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Find the number of observations missing date_of_admission
nrow(linelist_cleaned %&gt;% filter(is.na(date_of_admission))) </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="convert-and-clean-date-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Convert and clean date variables</h3>
<p>In linelist_cleaned there are seven variables containing dates (dateentry, epiquestdate, date_of_admission, date_of_onset, date_lab_sample_taken, dthospitalisation, dtdeath).</p>
<p>Because the Am Timan dataset contains date variables not found in the data dictionary, we will ignore and comment out the first code of the Date variables chunk (these commands convert only the date variables known to the data dictionary).</p>
<p>Instead, we uncomment and <strong>use the commands applicable to when a dataset does not align with the data dictionary</strong>. You may see messages warning that a few dates are not in the correct timeframe - this is ok and these dates will be addressed in the next step.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Use this is your dataset aligns with the data dictionary
# Creates list of date variables from the data dictionary
#DATEVARS &lt;- filter(linelist_dict, data_element_valuetype == &quot;DATE&quot;) %&gt;% 
#  select(data_element_shortname) # select date vars
# change to the date variables found in your dataset to class date 
#linelist_cleaned &lt;- linelist_cleaned %&gt;%
#  mutate_at(DATEVARS$data_element_shortname, as.Date)

# Use this if your dataset does not align with the data dictionary
  linelist_cleaned &lt;- linelist_cleaned %&gt;%
    mutate_at(vars(matches(&quot;date|Date&quot;)), linelist::guess_dates,
            error_tolerance = 0.5)</code></pre>
<p>The code above converted successfully many of our date variables (remember you can check class like <code>class(linelist$date_of_onset</code>). However, did not detect the variables named with “dt”, such as “dtdeath” and “dthospitalization”. We must <strong>convert those variables manually</strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Individually convert other date columns
class(linelist_cleaned$dtdeath)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>linelist_cleaned$dtdeath &lt;- linelist::guess_dates(linelist_cleaned$dtdeath)

class(linelist_cleaned$dtdeath)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Date&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Repeat for variable &quot;dtdeath&quot;
linelist_cleaned$dthospitalisation &lt;- linelist::guess_dates(linelist_cleaned$dthospitalisation)</code></pre>
<p>Next we uncomment code to <strong>correct unrealistic dates</strong>. We have browsed our data and know that there are observations with date_of_onset outside the reasonable range:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Check range of date_of_onset values, ignoring (removing) missing values
range(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2014-11-01&quot; &quot;2017-12-27&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We convert dates outside the expected range (April 2016 to October 2017) to missing using case_when(). Note that when making the assignment on the right-hand side (RHS), wrap NA in as.Date().</p>
<p>As you modify this chunk for your own situation, remember to include commas at the end of each case_when() line (except the last one), and that <strong>each left-hand side (LHS) of the ~ must be a logical statement</strong>, not just a value. Best is to write case_when() lines from most specific at top to most general at bottom. You can read more about case_when() <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: All the right-hand side (RHS) values must be the same class (either character, numeric, etc.). So, if your other RHS values are character and you want one RHS value to be missing, you cannot just write <code>NA</code> on the RHS. Instead you must use the special character version of <code>NA</code> : <code>NA_character_</code>.</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code># Convert dates before April 2016 or after October 2017 to missing (NA)
linelist_cleaned &lt;- mutate(linelist_cleaned,
                           date_of_onset = case_when(
                                 date_of_onset &lt; as.Date(&quot;2016-04-01&quot;)  ~ as.Date(NA),
                                 date_of_onset &gt; as.Date(&quot;2017-10-31&quot;)  ~ as.Date(NA),
                                 TRUE                                   ~ date_of_onset
                                 ))</code></pre>
<p>We also must <strong>use the provided code to create a variable called “epiweek”</strong>. While there are already variables in our dataset that give the epidemiological weeks of various data points, it is safer to make a new variable AND later code chunks rely on the variable being named “epiweek”. See the documentation of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aweek/vignettes/introduction.html">package “aweek”</a> for more information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create variable epiweek
linelist_cleaned$epiweek &lt;- aweek::date2week(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, 
                                             floor_day = TRUE, 
                                             factor = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><em>A note on the epiweek variable and factors:<br />
Notice that we converted dates to NA that were clearly errors <strong>before</strong> creating the epiweek variable. This is because the epiweek variable is created as a <strong>factor</strong>, and once a factor is created it is more difficult to remove factor levels. YOu can read more about factors and dropping unused factor levels here TODO Advanced Functions R Guide link.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="clean-numeric-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Clean numeric variables</h3>
<p>We can <strong>comment out/ignore the code that makes a new numeric variable “obs_days”</strong>, because we do not have a date_of_exit in our dataset.</p>
<p><strong>However, we do need to clean the variable “age_years”</strong>. If we look at the range of values, we get something strange:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># See the range of age_years values, removing (excluding) NA
range(linelist_cleaned$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;0.08&quot; &quot;9&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We know there are ages older than 9 years. We check <code>class(linelist_cleaned$age_years)</code> and see that R is reading this variable as class <em>character</em>, not numeric! So we must convert it by adding the following command to the script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Convert variable age_years to numeric class
linelist_cleaned$age_years &lt;- as.numeric(linelist_cleaned$age_years)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Now we must further clean the age-related variables.</strong> In the chunk “Age group variables”, we do not need and can comment out the code to add under 2 years to the age_years variable. However, we do have some decimal years. To align with the data dictionary we uncomment and <strong>use the code to create a <em>new</em> variable “age_months” from the decimal years</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># For patients under 5 years, the new variable age_months is based on age_years * 12 
linelist_cleaned &lt;- mutate(linelist_cleaned,
                            age_months = case_when(
                              age_years &lt; 5 ~ age_years * 12
                              )) </code></pre>
<p>We can then use the code to create an age group variable based on age_months.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## create age group variable for under 5 years based on months
linelist_cleaned$age_group_mon &lt;- age_categories(linelist_cleaned$age_months, 
                                                 breakers = c(0, 6, 9, 12, 24), 
                                                 ceiling = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>…and use the similar code for groups of age_years. A note on grouping using age_categories(): for example with breakers 0, 3, 15, 30, and 45, a 30-year old patient will be included in an age_group named “30-44”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## create an age group variable by specifying categorical breaks
linelist_cleaned$age_group &lt;- age_categories(linelist_cleaned$age_years, 
                                             breakers = c(0, 3, 15, 30, 45))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="cleaning-categorical-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Cleaning categorical variables</h3>
<p>While the template directs us to next create a DIED variable based on exit_status containing the characters “Dead”, we must first <strong>clean our exit_status variable, which is currrently in French</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Use case_when() to assign new values for a new exit_status2 variable</strong>, as in the code below. The code uses the function case_when() to re-define linelist_cleaned as itself, but mutated to include the new variable exit_status2. The values in exit_status2 are based on the values in exit_status, such that when exist_status == “Décédé”, the value in exit_status2 is “Died”, and so on.</p>
<p>As you modify this chunk for your own situation, remember to include commas at the end of each case_when() line (except the last one), and that <strong>each left-hand side (LHS) of the ~ must be a logical statement</strong>, not just a value.

<div id="re-code-values-in-patient_facility_type" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Re-code values in patient_facility_type</strong></h3>
<p>When we assigned our variables to match the data dictionary, we used the variable “hospitalisation” as the variable “patient_facility_type”. <strong>However, the values in that variable do not match those expected by the template.</strong> In the data dictionary, patient_facility_type should have values of “Inpatient” or “Outpatient.” Currently, the values are “Oui” and “Non”. In later code chunks, analyses are restricted to observations where patient_facility_type == “Inpatient”, thus, we should align the values to match the data dictionary.</p>

<h3>Cleaning patient origin</h3>
<p>The variable patient_origin was originally the variable <em>quartier</em> in the raw dataset. <strong>patient_origin is referenced in the place analyses chunks</strong>, for example when calculating attack rates by region.

<p><strong>However, the place names in population_data_region are ALL CAPITAL LETTERS and this is not true in linelist_cleaned - the join will not register any matches.</strong> The easiest way to solve this problem is to redefine the linelist_cleaned variable into all capital letters as well, using the base R function toupper():</p>
