## Provide population counts  

The population estimates for regions and age groups are collected in order to calculate attack and mortality rates. **The template allows several ways to provide population estimates, but importantly, the data must be stored under specific variable names.** In your real-use case, the specific age groupings and region names in your data may differ from the examples, but the variable names must follow the expected standard.  

You can do one of the following:  

A) Import a spreadsheet file with the estimates in the correct format  
B) Use the function `gen_population()` to derive the estimates from proportions  

![](/images/AJS_Population_Counts.png)  

**For this case study, we import an Excel spreadsheet containing population data by quartier (available for download in case study overview page).**  

See the read_population_data chunk and modify the command to import the Excel spreadsheet. The command uses `import()` wrapped around `here()` to locate the file. The `which=` argument of `import()` specifies that the sheet "quartier" should be imported.  

Note that the variables names in the spreadsheet have already been edited to match the expected variable names ("patient_origin" and "population").  

{{% notice note %}}
The `import()` function is wrapped around the `here()` function. The `here()` function makes it easy for R to locate files within a project. It is best to save the dataset within your R project, and to provide `here()` with any R project subfolder names. You can read more about the `here()` function in the data import page of the R Basics tutorial.
{{% /notice %}}

Delete or comment (#) all the code lines in the chunk that create fake data for `population_data_region`, `population_data_age`, and `population_data_age_months`.


```{r include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
population_data_region <- rio::import(here("content", "training", "Walk-through", "AJS_AmTiman_population_revised_for_template.xlsx"), which="quartier")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
population_data_region <- rio::import(here("AJS_AmTiman_population_revised_for_template.xlsx"), which="quartier")
```


**If you choose not to complete the population estimates section at all, delete the default `gen_population()` code, and expect that later sections on attack and mortality rates will not produce output.**




```{r, include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Save population_data_region for this website page as "population_data" for use in the next page.
saveRDS(population_data_region, "data/population_data.rds")
```




## Provide laboratory testing data  

In this example, laboratory testing data is already included in the linelist dataset. Therefore, there is no need to import a separate laboratory testing dataset.  

If you have a separate laboratory dataset, use the alterate code provided in the template to import and then join that dataset to the linelist dataset. You can join them based on an ID or case number variable that is present in both datasets. For more information about joins, see the Advanced and Miscellaneous R Basics page.
