**In this template section you choose the appropriate code chunk to import your linelist dataset.** The linelist Excel file can be downloaded from the case study overview page.  

For this exercise our linelist dataset is a **non-DHIS file**, so to import we use the `read_nonDHIS_data` code chunk.  

**Comment out (using #) or delete the `read_fake_data`, `read_DHIS_data`, and `prep_DHIS_data` chunks**, as they are not necessary and will cause errors.

**Importing the dataset into R**  

Use the `import()` function of the **rio** package to import an Excel file that is not password protected. The `which=` argument of `import()` specifies that the sheet "linelist" should be imported.  

The `import()` function is wrapped around the `here()` function. The `here()` function makes it easy for R to locate files on your computer. It is best to save the dataset within an R project, and to provide `here()` with any R project subfolder names. **You can read more about `import()` and `here()` functions in the importing data R Basics page.**  



```{r eval=FALSE}
## Read data ------------------------------------
# Excel file
# to read in a specific sheet use "which"
linelist_raw <- rio::import(here::here("AJS_AmTiman.xlsx"), which = "linelist")
```

A successfull import should result in a dataframe object named `linelist_raw` in your RStudio Environment pane, consisting of 1447 observations and 122 variables.

```{r include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This code chunk runs in the background and actually imports the dataset while transforming "." to NA.
# The import code chunk above (with eval=FALSE) does not run, but shows the viewer the default import code.
linelist_raw <- rio::import("AJS_AmTiman.xlsx", which = "linelist", na=".")
```


```{r, include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Save linelist_raw as "linelist_raw" for use in the next page (dataset alignment).
saveRDS(linelist_raw, "data/linelist_raw.rds")
```
