## Everything is an object  

Everything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are **objects** which are **assigned a name** and **can be referenced** in later commands.  

An object exists when you have assigned it a value (see the assignment section below). When it is assigned a value, the object appears in the Environment (see the upper right pane of RStudio). It can then be operated upon, manipulated, changed, and re-defined.

## Creating objects with the Assignment Operator <-  

**You create objects *by assigning them a value* with the <- operator.** You can think of the assignment operator `<-` as the words "is defined as". Assignment commands generally follow a standard order:  
  
 
**object_name**  <-  **value** (or process/calculation that produce a value)

> **As an example:** When using an outbreak template you want to record the current reporting week for later reference. The object reporting_week is created when it is assigned the character value "2018-W10". reporting_week will appear in the R Environment (upper-right pane) and can be referenced in later commands.

> See the commands and their output in the boxes below. Note the [1] in the output is simply indicating that you are viewing the first (and only) item of the output

```{r}
reporting_week <- "2018-W10"   # creates the object reporting_week by assigning a value

reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week
```
*IMPORTANT: **An object's value can be over-written** at any time by running an assignment command to re-define its value. Thus, the **order of the commands run is very important**.*
```{r}
reporting_week <- "2018-W51"   # assigns a NEW value to the object reporting_week

reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week
```

**Datasets are also assigned names and defined as objects when they are imported.** In the code below:  

1) The object linelist_raw is created and assigned the value of an imported CSV file  

2) The object linelist_cleaned is created and assigned the value of linelist_raw  

3) linelist_cleaned is re-defined as itself, but mutated to include a new variable, obs_days, representing the number of days between patient admission and exit

```{r eval=FALSE}
# linelist_raw is created and assigned the value of the imported CSV file
linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")

# linelist_cleaned is created and assigned the value of linelist_raw
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

# linelist_cleaned is RE-defined as itself, but modified to include a new variable
linelist_cleaned <- mutate(linelist_cleaned, 
                           obs_days = as.numeric(date_of_exit - date_of_admission))


```

A quick note on naming of objects:

  * Object names must not contain spaces, but you should use underscore (_) or a period (.) instead of a space.  
  * Object names are case-sensitive (meaning that Dataset_A is different from dataset_A). 
  * Object names must begin with a letter (cannot begin with a number like 1, 2 or 3).  

## Objects can have Structure  

Objects can be a single piece of data (e.g. `my_number <- 24`), or they can consist of structured data. The graphic below, sourced from [this online R tutorial](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html) shows some common data structures and their names. Not included in this image is spatial data, which is discussed in another page.  

![](/images/r_data_structures.png)  

Using the templates, you will *most commonly* encounter data frames and vectors:  


Common structure | Explanation | Example from templates
------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------  
Vectors | A container for a sequence of singular objects, all of the same class (e.g. numeric, character). | **"Variables" (columns) in data frames are vectors** (e.g. the variable age_years).  
Data Frames | Vectors (e.g. columns) that are bound together that all have the same number of rows. | linelist_raw and linelist_cleaned are both data frames.  

### Using `$` to access/call variables  

**Vectors within a data frame (variables in a dataset) can be called or referenced using the $ symbol.** The `$` symbol connects the name of the column to the name of its dataset. The $ symbol must be used, otherwise R will not know where to look for or create the column.

```{r}
# Retrieve the length of the vector age_years
# (age_years is in the data frame linelist_cleaned)
length(linelist_cleaned$age_years)  
```
  
  
## Objects have Classes  

All the objects stored in R have a *class* which tells R how to handle the object. There are many possible classes, but common ones include:

Class |	Explanation | Examples
------ | ------------------------------------------ |  -----------------------------
Character	| These are text/words/sentences **"within quotation marks"**. Math cannot be done on these objects.	| "Character objects are in quotation marks"  
Numeric	| These are numbers and **can include decimals**. If within quotation marks the will be considered character. | 23.1 or 14  
Integer | Numbers that are **whole only** (no decimals) | -5, 14, or 2000  
Factor | These are vectors that have a **specified order** or hierarchy of values | Variable msf_involvement with ordered values N, S, SUB, and U.  
Date | **Once R is told that certain data are Dates**, these data can be manipulated and displayed in special ways. See the page on Dates for more information. | 2018-04-12 or 15/3/1954 or Wed 4 Jan 1980  
Logical | Values must be one of the two special values TRUE or FALSE (note these are **not** "TRUE" and "FALSE" in quotation marks) | TRUE or FALSE  
data.frame | A data frame is how R stores a **typical dataset**. It consists of vectors (columns) of data bound together, that all have the same number of observations (rows). | The example AJS dataset named linelist_raw contains 68 variables with 300 observations (rows) each.  

**You can test the class of an object by writing it within the function class()**. Note: you can reference a specific column within a dataset using the `$` notation to separate the name of the dataset and the name of the column.

```{r echo=TRUE}
class(linelist_raw$age_years)
class(linelist_raw$patient_origin)
```

The templates sometimes contain code converting objects between classes.

Function | Action  
----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------    
as.character() | Converts to character class  
as.numeric() | Converts to numeric class  
as.integer() | Converts to integer class
as.Date() | Converts to Date class - Note: see section on dates for details  
as.factor() | Converts to factor - Note: re-defining order of value levels requires extra arguments

## Functions  

### Simple Functions  

Most tasks in R are performed through functions. **A function is like a machine that receives inputs, does some action with those inputs, and produces an output.** What the output is depends on the function.  
  
  
On installation, R contains "base" functions that perform common tasks. Specialized functions have been created by R users, verified by the R community, and can be downloaded within "packages" to your RStudio for use. One of the more challenging aspects of R is that there are often many functions to choose from to complete a given task.  
  
  
**Functions typically operate upon some object placed within the function's parentheses**. For example, when the function summary() is used on a variable of class numeric, the output is a summary of the variable's numeric and missing values.

```{r}
summary(linelist_raw$age_years)
```

### Functions with Multiple Arguments  

Functions often ask for several inputs. **Each piece of information needed is called an argument**. Some arguments are required for the function to work correctly, some are optional. Arguments can take character, numeric, logical (TRUE/FALSE), and other inputs. Optional arguments have default settings if they are not specified. Arguments are all located within the parentheses of the function, **separated by commas**.  
  
  
>**For example**, this descriptive() command in the templates creates a descriptive summary table of counts and proportions. In this command the function is given three arguments, establishing linelist_cleaned as the data frame to use, age_group as the variable to count, and sex as the variable to use for groupings.

```{r include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## create an age group variable by specifying categorical breaks
linelist_cleaned$age_group <- age_categories(linelist_cleaned$age_years, 
                                             breakers = c(0, 3, 15, 30, 45))

```



```{r}
# Creates a descriptive table by specifying the dataframe and two columns
descriptive(df = linelist_cleaned, counter = "age_group", grouper = "sex")
```

> Often, the first half of argument assignment (e.g. `df = `) does not need to be specified if the arguments are written in a specific order (specified in the function's documentation). The below code produces the exact same table as above, because the function expects the argument order: data frame, counter variable, grouper variable. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# This command will produce the same table as above
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group", "sex")
```

**A more complex descriptive() command might include the optional arguments to add a Total column and row to the table.** This is done by including the argument coltotals and rowtotals, both set to equal TRUE (their default is FALSE).

*Note: For arguments specified with an equals symbol (e.g. coltotals = ...), their order among the arguments is not important (must still be within the parentheses and separated by commas).* 

```{r}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group", "sex", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE)
```

### Using Additional Functions  

R comes with "base" functions, but the R community has created and verified many other specialized functions that are available to you. These *functions* are contained within **packages** that can be downloaded to your computer. Once downloaded, you access the functions within a package by calling the package with the library() command at the beginning of each R session.

**Note: While you only have to install packages once, you must load them at the beginning of every R session using library().** There is a code chunk at the beginning of each template that loads the necessary packages. 

Think of R as your personal library: When you download a package your library gains a book of functions, but each time you want to use a function in that book, you must borrow that book from your library.  

For clarity in the templates, functions are often preceeded by the name of their package using the :: symbol in the following way:  

package_name::function_name()
 
```{r eval=FALSE}
#This line uses the package "rio"" and it's function "import" to import a dataset
linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")
```



### The Pipe Operator %>% between functions 

Within the template scripts you will see the pipe operator %>%. Simply explained, the pipe operator passes an intermediate output from one function to the next. You can think of it as saying "then". Many functions can be linked together with %>%.  

Piping is not a base function. To use piping, the dplyr package must be installed and loaded. Near the top of every template script is a code chunk that installs and loads the necessary packages, including dplyr. You can read more about piping [here](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/)

> **As an example:** The following code chunk from the AJD template data cleaning section can be read as "linelist_cleaned is defined as linelist_cleaned, filtered to remove the rows where the variables case_number and date_of_admission are missing"  

``` {r eval=FALSE}
# only keep variables with a case ID and a date of consultation
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(case_number) & !is.na(date_of_admission))
```


## Relational and logical operators  

**Relational operators compare values** and are often used when defining new variables and subsets of datasets. Here are the common relational operators in R:  

Function | Operator	| Example	| Result
-------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------  
Equal to |	`==` | `"A" == "a"`	| `FALSE` (because R is case sensitive) *Note that == (double equals) is different from = (single equals), which acts like the assignment operator <-*  
Not equal to | `!=`	| `2 != 0` | `TRUE`  
Greater than | `>` | `4 > 2` | `TRUE`  
Less than | `<` | `4 < 2` | `FALSE`  
Greater than or equal to | `>=` | `6 >= 4` | `TRUE`  
Less than or equal to	| `<=` | `6 <= 4` | `FALSE`  
Value is missing | `is.na()` | `is.na(7)` | `FALSE` (special case, see section on missing values)
Value is not missing | `!is.na()` | `!is.na(7)` | `TRUE`

**Logical operators, such as AND and OR, are often used to connect relational operators and create more complicated criteria**. Complex statements might require parentheses ( ) for grouping and order of application.  

Function | Operator
-------- | ------------------------  
AND | `&`  
OR |  `|` (vertical bar)  
Parentheses	| ( ) Used to group criteria together and clarify order  

> For example, the command below use the function case_when to create the new variable "case_def" such that:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  mutate(case_def = case_when(
    is.na(hep_e_rdt) & is.na(other_cases_in_hh)           ~ NA_character_,
    hep_e_rdt == "Positive"                               ~ "Confirmed",
    hep_e_rdt != "Positive" & other_cases_in_hh == "Yes"  ~ "Probable",
    TRUE                                                  ~ "Suspected"
  ))

```


Criteria in example above                        | Resulting value in new variable "case_def""
------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
If the value for variables hep_e_rdt and other_cases_in_hh are missing | NA (missing)  
If the value in hep_e_rdt is "Positive" | "Confirmed"  
If the value in hep_e_rdt is NOT "Positive" AND the value in other_cases_in_hh is "Yes" | "Probable"  
If one of the above criteria are not met | "Suspected"  


*Note that R is case-sensitive, so "Positive" is different than "positive"...*  

## Missing Values
**In R, missing values are represented by the special value NA** (capital letters N and A - not in quotation marks). If you import data that records missing data in another way (e.g. 99, "Missing", or .), you may want to re-code those values to NA.
  
**To test whether a value is NA, use the special function is.na()**, which returns TRUE or FALSE.
```{r}
rdt_result <- NA   # Assigns the object rdt_result with the value NA (missing)
is.na(rdt_result)  # Tests whether the value of rdt_result is NA
```


## Calculations  

Mathematical operators are often used to perform addition, division, to create new columns, etc. Below are how to use mathematical operators in R. Whether you put spaces around the operators is not important.  

Objective	      | Example in R
--------------  | -------------
addition	      | 2+3    
subtraction	    | 2-3    
multiplication	| 2*3
division	      | 30/5
exponent	      | 2^3 or 2**3   
order of operations | ( )


## General Syntax  

A few things to remember when writing commands in R:  

* Always close parentheses
* Avoid spaces - in column and object names, etc. Use underscore ( _ ) or periods ( . ) instead
* Keep track of and do not forget to separate a function's arguments with commas
* R is case-sensitive, meaning "Variable A" is *different* from "variable A"

## Errors and Warnings  

When a command is run, the R Console may show you warning or error messages in red text.  

* A **warning** means that R has completed your command, but had to take additional steps that you may want to be aware of (e.g. remove rows from a calculation that had missing values).  

* An **error** means that R was not able to complete your command.
