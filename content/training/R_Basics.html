<div id="everything-is-an-object" class="section level2">
<h2>Everything is an object</h2>
<p>Everything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are <strong>objects</strong> which are <strong>assigned a name</strong> and <strong>can be referenced</strong> in later commands.</p>
<p>An object exists when you have assigned it a value (see the assignment section below). When it is assigned a value, the object appears in the Environment (see the upper right pane of RStudio). It can then be operated upon, manipulated, changed, and re-defined.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-objects-with-the-assignment-operator--" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating objects with the Assignment Operator &lt;-</h2>
<p><strong>You create objects <em>by assigning them a value</em> with the &lt;- operator.</strong> You can think of the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code> as the words “is defined as”. Assignment commands generally follow a standard order:</p>
<p><strong>object_name</strong> &lt;- <strong>value</strong> (or process/calculation that produce a value)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As an example:</strong> When using an outbreak template you want to record the current reporting week for later reference. The object reporting_week is created when it is assigned the character value “2018-W10”. reporting_week will appear in the R Environment (upper-right pane) and can be referenced in later commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See the commands and their output in the boxes below. Note the [1] in the output is simply indicating that you are viewing the first (and only) item of the output</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code>reporting_week &lt;- &quot;2018-W10&quot;   # creates the object reporting_week by assigning a value

reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2018-W10&quot;</code></pre>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: <strong>An object’s value can be over-written</strong> at any time by running an assignment command to re-define its value. Thus, the <strong>order of the commands run is very important</strong>.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>reporting_week &lt;- &quot;2018-W51&quot;   # assigns a NEW value to the object reporting_week

reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2018-W51&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Datasets are also assigned names and defined as objects when they are imported.</strong> In the code below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The object linelist_raw is created and assigned the value of an imported CSV file</p></li>
<li><p>The object linelist_cleaned is created and assigned the value of linelist_raw</p></li>
<li><p>linelist_cleaned is re-defined as itself, but mutated to include a new variable, obs_days, representing the number of days between patient admission and exit</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># linelist_raw is created and assigned the value of the imported CSV file
linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(&quot;linelist.csv&quot;)

# linelist_cleaned is created and assigned the value of linelist_raw
linelist_cleaned &lt;- linelist_raw

# linelist_cleaned is RE-defined as itself, but modified to include a new variable
linelist_cleaned &lt;- mutate(linelist_cleaned, 
                           obs_days = as.numeric(date_of_exit - date_of_admission))</code></pre>
<p>A quick note on naming of objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object names must not contain spaces, but you should use underscore (_) or a period (.) instead of a space.<br />
</li>
<li>Object names are case-sensitive (meaning that Dataset_A is different from dataset_A).</li>
<li>Object names must begin with a letter (cannot begin with a number like 1, 2 or 3).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="objects-can-have-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Objects can have Structure</h2>
<p>Objects can be a single piece of data (e.g. <code>my_number &lt;- 24</code>), or they can consist of structured data. The graphic below, sourced from <a href="http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html">this online R tutorial</a> shows some common data structures and their names. Not included in this image is spatial data, which is discussed in another page.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<div id="simple-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Simple Functions</h3>
<p>Most tasks in R are performed through functions. <strong>A function is like a machine that receives inputs, does some action with those inputs, and produces an output.</strong> What the output is depends on the function.</p>
<p>On installation, R contains “base” functions that perform common tasks. Specialized functions have been created by R users, verified by the R community, and can be downloaded within “packages” to your RStudio for use. One of the more challenging aspects of R is that there are often many functions to choose from to complete a given task.</p>
<p><strong>Functions typically operate upon some object placed within the function’s parentheses</strong>. For example, when the function summary() is used on a variable of class numeric, the output is a summary of the variable’s numeric and missing values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(linelist_raw$age_years)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA&#39;s 
##    3.00   32.00   57.00   59.27   86.00  120.00      11</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="functions-with-multiple-arguments" class="section level3">
<h3>Functions with Multiple Arguments</h3>
<p>Functions often ask for several inputs. <strong>Each piece of information needed is called an argument</strong>. Some arguments are required for the function to work correctly, some are optional. Arguments can take character, numeric, logical (TRUE/FALSE), and other inputs. Optional arguments have default settings if they are not specified. Arguments are all located within the parentheses of the function, <strong>separated by commas</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>For example</strong>, this descriptive() command in the templates creates a descriptive summary table of counts and proportions. In this command the function is given three arguments, establishing linelist_cleaned as the data frame to use, age_group as the variable to count, and sex as the variable to use for groupings.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># Creates a descriptive table by specifying the dataframe and two columns
descriptive(df = linelist_cleaned, counter = &quot;age_group&quot;, grouper = &quot;sex&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 7
##   age_group   F_n F_prop   M_n M_prop   U_n U_prop
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 0-2           0   0        0      0     0   0

## 6 Missing       3   2.70     4      4     4   4.49</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, the first half of argument assignment (e.g. <code>df =</code>) does not need to be specified if the arguments are written in a specific order (specified in the function’s documentation). The below code produces the exact same table as above, because the function expects the argument order: data frame, counter variable, grouper variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># This command will produce the same table as above
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, &quot;age_group&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>A more complex descriptive() command might include the optional arguments to add a Total column and row to the table.</strong> This is done by including the argument coltotals and rowtotals, both set to equal TRUE (their default is FALSE).</p>

<div id="using-additional-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Using Additional Functions</h3>
<p>R comes with “base” functions, but the R community has created and verified many other specialized functions that are available to you. These <em>functions</em> are contained within <strong>packages</strong> that can be downloaded to your computer. Once downloaded, you access the functions within a package by calling the package with the library() command at the beginning of each R session.</p>
<p><strong>Note: While you only have to install packages once, you must load them at the beginning of every R session using library().</strong> There is a code chunk at the beginning of each template that loads the necessary packages.</p>
<p>Think of R as your personal library: When you download a package your library gains a book of functions, but each time you want to use a function in that book, you must borrow that book from your library.</p>
<p>For clarity in the templates, functions are often preceeded by the name of their package using the :: symbol in the following way:</p>
<p>package_name::function_name()</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#This line uses the package &quot;rio&quot;&quot; and it&#39;s function &quot;import&quot; to import a dataset
linelist_raw &lt;- rio::import(&quot;linelist.xlsx&quot;, which = &quot;Sheet1&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-pipe-operator-between-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>The Pipe Operator %&gt;% between functions</h3>
<p>Within the template scripts you will see the pipe operator %&gt;%. Simply explained, the pipe operator passes an intermediate output from one function to the next. You can think of it as saying “then”. Many functions can be linked together with %&gt;%.</p>
<p>Piping is not a base function. To use piping, the dplyr package must be installed and loaded. Near the top of every template script is a code chunk that installs and loads the necessary packages, including dplyr. You can read more about piping <a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/">here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As an example:</strong> The following code chunk from the AJD template data cleaning section can be read as “linelist_cleaned is defined as linelist_cleaned, filtered to remove the rows where the variables case_number and date_of_admission are missing”</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># only keep variables with a case ID and a date of consultation
