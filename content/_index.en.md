## What we do

This project aims to help MSF field epidemiologists use the R statistical 
language to create standardized and automated situation reports that will reduce
the amount of time spent wrangling data so that they can spend more time 
understanding the contex of an outbreak situation. 

You can read about our collaboration in [our introductory
article](https://blogs.msf.org/bloggers/larissa/innovation-introducing-r4epis)
and our [recent
hackathon](https://blogs.msf.org/bloggers/r4epis-team/r4epis-hackathon).

## Templates

We have created a set of templates for use outbreak scenarios.
To install the templates and code, you can use the `pak` R package:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("R4EPI/sitrep")
```
