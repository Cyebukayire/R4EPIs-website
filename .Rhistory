## to save space. For example, Yes/No values will often be coded as 1 or 0 and

## IF YOUR LINELIST NOT AN EXPORT OF DATA FROM DHIS2 USE THIS CODE CHUNK ------
##
## This assumes your data does not fit the standardised MSF data dictionary for
## this disease. If you are using this section, be aware that this template may
## not work simply due to the unpredictable nature of non-standardized data
##
## Checklist to clean and update this script to match your data ---------------
##
## - [ ] Recode your variable names to match this analysis
## - [ ] Recode variable contents
## - [ ] Check the code later in the script and update it to fit your names/contents
## - [ ] Make sure to comment out all lines in read_DHIS_excel_data chunk
##
## You will still need to read in the standardised data dictionary
##   This is to understand which variables are being used later in the script
##   So that you can adapt those later code chunks to fit your dataset.
## The data dictionary has variable names in the data_element_shortname column.
## Possible values for each variable are specified in the Code and Name columns.
## Where code has the shortened values and name has the full text values.
##
## - [ ] run this to look at the data dictionary:
linelist_dict <- msf_dict("AJS")
#View(linelist_dict)
## Read data ------------------------------------
# Excel file
# to read in a specific sheet use "which"
linelist_raw <- rio::import("AJS_AmTiman.xlsx", which = "linelist", na = ".")
# For password protected Excel file
# use the excel.link package
# library(excel.link)
# linelist_raw <- xl.read.file("linelist.xlsx",
#                              xl.sheet = "Sheet1",
#                              password = askpass::askpass("please enter file password"))
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")
#
# Stata data file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.dat")
## Fixing variable names ----------------------
## make a copy of your orginal dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw
# define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package
# this function is preset rules for variable naming
# for example it changes spaces and dots to "_" and characters to lowercase
cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))
# overwrite variable names with defined clean names
colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames
## Renaming variables to match the template -------------------------------
## OPTIONAL: below is just an example in case you want to specifically change a
## few names you can also change specific var names using the *rename*
## function. In this example, we have the columns "gender" and "age" that we
## want to rename as "sex" and "age_years".
## The formula for this is rename(data, NEW_NAME = OLD_NAME).
# linelist_cleaned <- rename(linelist_cleaned,
#                            gender    = sex, # TEXT
#                            age_years = age  # INTEGER_POSITIVE
# )
## You can use the function msf_dict_rename_helper() to create a template based
## on the AJS dictionary.
# This will copy a rename command like the one above
## to your clipboard.
msf_dict_rename_helper("AJS")
## Paste the result here and add add the column names from linelist_cleaned
## to the appropriate variables. PLEASE NOTE: this is not a foolproof solution;
## you still need to be aware of what each variable means and what values it
## takes.
##
## If there are any variables that are in the MSF dictionary that are not in
## your data set, then you should comment them out, but be aware that some
## analyses may not run because of this.
## OPTIONAL: if you only want to keep certain variables -
## you can select these by name or column number view the names of your vars
## and their column number using: names(linelist_cleaned) this example keeps
## the first three columns as well as age_years and sex variables
# linelist_cleaned <- select(linelist_cleaned, c(1:3, "age_years", "sex")
## Add the appropriate column names after the equals signs

## USE THIS TO READ IN POPULATION OR TO CREATE IT FROM PROPORTIONS  -----------
##
## There are two options for using population data here.
## The first one is where you only know the total population number, and the
## proportion breakdown for categories (e.g. by age group, sex or region).
## The second option is to read in population from excel.
## In both cases you will need to make sure that the respective groups for
## population fit the groups in your linelist data set!
##
## Checklist for population data ----------------------------------------------
##
## - [ ] Decide if you have stratified population data available as counts or only proportions
## - [ ] If you have counts available:
##          - [ ] use View on the fake data generated to make sure your format in excel matches
##          - [ ] read in and clean data appropriately in the "Read data" section
##          - [ ] make sure the groups match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
## - [ ] If have total population and proportion breakdown available:
##          - [ ] use the gen_population function in "counts from populaiton proportions" section
##          - [ ] type in your population, groups, and respective proportions
##          - [ ] group can be any categorical variable you want
##          - [ ] make sure the groups match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
## - [ ] DELETE OR COMMENT OUT THE UNUSED SECTION

## USE THIS TO CREATE AND CLEAN VARIABLES IN YOUR DATA  -----------------------
##
## All your data cleaning and new variable creation should happen in this chunk.
## This way, if you mess up all you have to do is push the small arrow at the
## top of this chunk between the cogg and the play buttons, to run all the
## code chunks up to the current one, then continue your cleaning from where you
## started.
##
## YOU WILL NEED TO ADAPT THIS SECTION ACCORDING TO YOUR DATA!
##
## currently there are examples of cleaning for:
##    - Date variables
##    - Numeric variables
##    - Categorical variables from numerics (e.g. age groups)
##    - Factor variables (for creating/manipulating categorical variables)
